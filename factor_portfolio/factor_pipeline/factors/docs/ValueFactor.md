# ðŸ“Š Value Factor Overview

The **Value Factor** aims to capture stocks that appear undervalued based on various financial metrics. This factor is commonly used in quantitative investing to identify securities that may be trading below their intrinsic worth.

In this implementation, the Value Factor is computed using both raw financial ratios and derived metrics sourced from pricing, fundamentals, and valuation data.

## ðŸ§® Graham Number Handling

If `graham_number` is missing for a row, it is backfilled using:

\[
\text{Graham Number} = \sqrt{22.5 \times \text{EPS Actual} \times \text{Book Value per Share}}
\]

This is dynamically computed from the latest available EPS and Book Value data.
